### Cariñosa (2015)

_Commissioned by Ensemble Gô  
_

The _cariñosa_ is a Philippine dance of Spanish origin; though I have borrowed the name, my piece bears little resemblance to it, except for its harmonic basis and two occasions in which the traditional _cariñosa_ tune is quoted. The music that surrounds these two quotations is inspired by various elements of indigenous Philippine music, though some of them may not be Filipino at all, if not entirely imagined.

Living in a foreign land, any cultural ties to home often become amplified. This piece is my response—that those ties aren’t necessarily what they seem. I may be imagining them like anyone else.

**Duration:** 7 minutes

**Premiere:** June 12, 2015, Himawari-no Sato Concert Hall, Yokohama, Japan • Ensemble Gô: Monique Lapins, violin; Dylan Lee, cello; Naoto Segawa, marimba
