### Kabihasnan (2013)

_Kabihasnan_ is loosely based on musical gestures and scale materials found in Philippine kulintang music. The piece attempts to reverse the standard roles of the instruments involved: piano and percussion emphasize melody through gong and chime-like sounds, while the flute and cello provide harmonic and timbral support. "Kabihasnan" means civilization in the Tagalog language.

**Instrumentation:** flute, cello, percussion (1 player: marimba, crotales), piano

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Premiere:** September 9, 2013, Conservatory Concert Hall, Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, Singapore • Achittapol Tinnarat, flute; Xie Tian, cello; Naoto Segawa, percussion, Zyrene Estallo, piano
