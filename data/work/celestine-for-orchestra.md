The Latin root of the word _Celestine_ is _caelestis_, meaning celestial, referring to the sky or heaven. It is also the name of a mineral with a subtle blue color. Unlike most of my other works, _Celestine_ takes no inspiration from any story, narrative, or other work of art; instead it is an exercise in melody and accompaniment. From beginning to end it is dominated by one tune, developed and transformed against a steady rhythmic backdrop and through various harmonic turns. It is a simple musical object, intended simply to charm and amuse.

_Celestine_ was commissioned by the Manila Symphony Orchestra and completed in New York City around Thanksgiving in 2017.
