### Creed (2013)

Though I made several attempts at orchestral music when I was younger (only two of which I ever completed, and only one surviving into the present), _Creed_ is my first attempt after having undertaken some formal study of orchestration. It is a short slow movement with a narrative directly based on the Nicene Creed. Despite the nature of the source material, there is no intent to express any specific religious meaning. The entire piece comprises a single large gesture: a gradual progression from an initial germ of an idea to a grand and resolute statement of profound belief, and, ultimately, prayerful contemplation.
