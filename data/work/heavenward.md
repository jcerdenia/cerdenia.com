### Heavenward (2014)

_Composed for Ensemble Gô_

**Heavenward,** my third in a cycle of independent pieces inspired by Japanese death poems (along with _On the Verge_ and _When You Contemplate the Waters_), was directly inspired by a haiku of Dohaku (died in 1675): Cargoless, / bound heavenward, / Ship of the moon (English translation from _Japanese Death Poems,_ ed. Yoel Hoffman, 1986). Unlike the previous two pieces in my “Death Haiku” cycle, I did not derive a musical narrative nor musical elements from Dohaku’s poem; neither did I wish to express the tragedy of the poet’s impending death, nor to comment on the gravity of death in general. Instead, I aimed to express a more personal reaction to the words. The piece depicts a gradual emotional ascent, beginning on a slow and dignified note and interspersed with brief moments of fleeting activity, harmonic instability and incremental tempo changes; eventually, it ends in a far different place. All the while, a three-note motive dominates the piece, appearing relatively unchanged throughout the piece.

**Instrumentation:** 2 violins, viola, cello, marimba

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Premiere:** May 2, 2014, Conservatory Concert Hall, Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, Singapore • Ensemble Gô: Monique Lapins and San Win Htike, violins; Victor Williams, viola; Dylan Lee, cello; Naoto Segawa, marimba
