### Dumagat Fantasy (2012)

_Composed for the Asian Contemporary Ensemble  
Finalist at the Thailand International Composition Festival (2012)  
_

_Dumagat Fantasy_ grew out of my recollection of fieldwork in 2009 with a community of Dumagats, an ethnic minority living in the Philippine highlands. The three inner movements—"Lito," "Cando," and "Nene"—are impressions of three Dumagat people that continue to intrigue me. True to the fantasy genre, the music is episodic and contains elements of improvisation; some ideas are tenacious, while others are more fleeting. I find that no amount of music is sufficient for much of what the Dumagats had to say about their daily struggles, culture, and aspirations.

This piece was originally composed for the Asian Contemporary Ensemble as part of the National University of Singapore Arts Festival in March 2012. The premiere, which took place at the University Cultural Centre, incorporated visual images and narration by a storyteller. This revised version is a condensed and purely musical recounting of the Dumagats's stories.
