### Two Movements (2011)

This piece, in two short movements, laments the breaking apart of otherwise vivid memories the further one looks back. Besides exploring different themes and characters, the music is constructed from a series of perfect fourths and tritones stacked upon one another.

**Instrumentation:** piano and cello

**Duration:** 8 minutes

**Premiere:** December 1, 2011, Cohen-Davison Family Theater, Peabody Institute, Baltimore, MD â€¢ James Ng, cello; Joshua Cerdenia, piano
