### Canario (2016)

_Covarrubias Horozco described the_ canario _in his_ Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española _(1611) as a type of ‘saltarelo gracioso’ that came to Spain from the Canary Islands. A piece called_ Endechas de canaria _appeared in Pisador’s vihuela book of 1552, and the dance was mentioned by Diego Sánchez de Badajoz in the_ Farsa de Sancta Bárbara _(published in his collected works of 1554), and by Cervantes, Lope de Vega and many other Spanish writers throughout the 17th century. Discussing its origins and character, Arbeau (_Orchésographie_, 1588) noted that its ‘passages are gay but nevertheless strange and fantastic with a strong barbaric flavour’._
