###### Composer's Note

_Bituin at Panganorin_ is a setting of a Tagalog poem by José Corazón de Jesús (1894–1932), also known as Huseng Batute. It was composed for Enrico Lagasca and first completed in New York City in October 2016. I later completed a revised version in the spring of 2019.

###### Text

Ako’y nagsapanganorin upang ikaw’y makausap\
At sa pisngi niyong langit ang dilim ko’y inilatag;\
Ang nais ko’y matapakan ka ng sapot kong mga ulap\
At nang yaong pagsikat mo’y ako lang ang makamalas:

Bituin kang sakdal gandang hatinggabi kung sumilang\
Na Buwan ang iyong ina at ang ama’y yaong Araw,\
Ang Araw na iyong ama nang malubog sa kanluran\
Ay nagsabi sa palad kong huwag kitang lalapitan.

Ako nama’y sumang-ayon dapwat ako’y Panganorin\
Na talagang hatinggabi kung lumapit sa Bituin,\
Kaya ikaw, Bituin ko’y nasuyo ko’t naging akin.

Liwanag mo at dilim ko’y magdamag ding naghalikan,\
Ngunit tayo’y inumaga! ...  Akong dilim ay naparam\
At natakot sa ama mong nandidilat sa silangan!

###### Translation

I come to the high heavens to speak with you\
And on your cheek, which is the sky, lay down my darkness;\
I wish to cover you with the clouds that clothe me\
And, when you shine, be its sole witness.

Star of perfect beauty that you are, who shines at midnight,\
Whose mother is the Moon and father is the Sun,\
The Sun, your father, as he set in the west\
Warned me not to come near you.

And I agreed though I am Heaven,\
Whose nature is at midnight to draw near the Star,\
Therefore you, my Star, have become mine.

Your light and my darkness kiss all night,\
But morning comes! ... I, who am darkness, slip away\
In fear of your father who wakes in the east!
