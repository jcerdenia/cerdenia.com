>A wider palette of colours was exploited by [Joshua Cerdenia] in _When You Contemplate The Waters_ (2013). Piano, [vibraphone] and more brass joined the ensemble in the metamorphosis of a rising three note motif, evoking a lotus blooming. Stillness with Rit Xu’s alto flute accompanied by Chen Yang’s [vibraphone], and the climactic orchestral roar near the end were some memorable moments.\

###### Composer's Note

An old haiku by Kyokusai (1816-1874) goes: "When you contemplate the waters at day break, you can hear the lotus blossom" (English translation from _Japanese Death Poems,_ ed. Yoel Hoffman, 1986), alluding to a popular but unsubstantiated belief that the lotus flower makes a subtle noise when it opens. Instead of approximating that imagined noise, _When You Contemplate the Waters_ affirms what the lotus traditionally symbolizes: purity, awakening, and life. The piece is built around two opposite forces: the water—fluid, unstable, and freely given to transformation; and the lotus—solid and assured in its purpose. Sometimes they are directly opposed; at other times it is more difficult to tell them apart. In the end the flower blossoms, emerging out of the murky waters.

_When You Contemplate the Waters_ is the second in a cycle of loosely related pieces inspired by Japanese death haiku, preceded by [_On the Verge_](/works/on-the-verge) and followed by [_Heavenward_](/works/heavenward). Furthermore, it is a kind of homage to Takemitsu, and is transparently inspired by _Rain Coming_, especially in its opening moments. Inevitably, it diverges in a completely different direction. It was written for the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory New Music Ensemble and completed in Baltimore in the spring of 2013.
