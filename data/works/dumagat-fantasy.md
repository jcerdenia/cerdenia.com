>The best piece, for my money, was ... [Joshua Cerdenia's] _Dumagat Fantasy_
inspired by the tribespeople of his native Philippines. A beautifully crafted and wholly coherent piece of writing which showed a keen understanding of instrumental colour, it deserves many more performances.\
**—Marc Rochester, _The Straits Times_**

###### Composer's Note

_Dumagat Fantasy_ grew out of my experience in 2009 of getting to know a Dumagat community in the southern Tagalog highlands. The three inner movements—"Lito," "Cando," and "Nene"—are musical impressions of three elders that continue to intrigue me. True to the fantasy genre, the music is episodic and contains elements of improvisation; some ideas are tenacious, while others are more fleeting. Ultimately, no amount of music is sufficient for what the Dumagat had expressed about their daily lives and and aspirations.

This piece was originally composed for Wong Kah Chun and the Asian Contemporary Ensemble as part of the National University of Singapore Arts Festival in March 2012. The premiere, which took place at the University Cultural Centre, incorporated visual images and narration by a storyteller. This revised version, completed in the same year, is a condensed and purely musical recounting of the Dumagat's stories.
