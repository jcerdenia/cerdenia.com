_Dumagat Fantasy_ grew out of my recollection of fieldwork in 2009 with a community of Dumagat in the southern Tagalog highlands. The three inner movements—"Lito," "Cando," and "Nene"—are impressions of three elders that continue to intrigue me. True to the fantasy genre, the music is episodic and contains elements of improvisation; some ideas are tenacious, while others are more fleeting. I find that no amount of music is sufficient for much of what the Dumagas had to say about their daily lives and and aspirations.

This piece was originally composed for Wong Kah Chun and the Asian Contemporary Ensemble as part of the National University of Singapore Arts Festival in March 2012. The premiere, which took place at the University Cultural Centre, incorporated visual images and narration by a storyteller. This revised version, completed in the same year, is a condensed and purely musical recounting of the Dumagat's stories.

_Dumagat Fantasy_ was selected for the Thailand International Composition Festival of 2012, and in 2013 awarded the Peabody Conservatory's Prix d'Été (2nd Prize).
