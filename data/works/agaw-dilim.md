###### Composer's Note

_Agaw-Dilim_ (Twilight) is a setting of a Tagalog poem by José Corazón de Jesús (1894–1932), also known as Huseng Batute. It was composed for Enrico Lagasca and completed in New York City in March 2017.

###### Text

Namatay ang araw\
sa dakong kanluran,\
nang kinabukasa'y\
pamuling sumilang,\
ngunit ikaw, irog, bakit nang pumanaw\
ay bukod-tangi kang di ko na namasdan?

Naluoy sa hardin\
ang liryo at hasmin,\
Mayo nang dumating\
pamuling nagsupling,\
ngunit ikaw, sinta, bakit kaya giliw\
dalawang Mayo nang nagtago sa akin?

Lumipad ang ibon\
sa pugad sa kahoy,\
dumating ang hapon\
at muling naroon,\
ngunit ikaw, buhay, ano't hangga ngayo'y\
di pa nagbabalik at di ko matunton?

###### Translation

The sun died\
out west,\
in the morning\
it rose again,\
but you, my dear, why, after you left,\
have I never seen you again? 

In the garden withered\
the lily and jasmine,\
come May,\
they sprang again,\
but you, my love, why, my darling,\
has May come and gone twice while you hide from me?

The birds flew away\
from their nest in the trees,\
afternoon came,\
and again they were there,\
but you, my life, why, until now,\
have you not returned where I can find you?
