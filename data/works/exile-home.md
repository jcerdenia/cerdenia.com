"It is part of morality not to be at home in one's home," as Adorno said.

_Exile/Home_ was commissioned by Melisa Tien for [SWELL](https://www.melisatien.com/swell), a collection of music theatre works by immigrants and children of immigrants. I wrote the text as well as the music, which I completed in Manila, Philippines in January 2021.
