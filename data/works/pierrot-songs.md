###### Composer's Note

_Pierrot Songs_ is a setting of three poems from Albert Giraud's influential _Pierrot lunaire: rondels bergamasques:_ "Décor," "Pantomime," and "Cuisine Lyrique" (Nos. 46, 37, and 7 in Giraud's cycle, respectively). Although the poems are vastly different from one another, I imagined tracing a progression from the surreal pink sunset over Pierrot's barren world to an empty sky illuminated by a freakishly yellow moon—and in between, a drunken dance-like intermezzo invoking the theatrics of Pierrot and his companions. I made no attempt to emulate the outlandish, extroverted character of Arnold Schoenberg's monumental setting of Giraud's text; instead I leaned towards a more introspective reading of the text—sensitive, but not uninhibitedly expressive, and conveying irony between the words and music. The result is a set of three very different short pieces, together forming a larger whole.

The cycle was originally titled _Between a Pink Sunset and a Yellow Moonrise_ and composed in 2012 for the Lunar Ensemble's Pierrot Centenary Project, which was initiated by Gemma New to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the premiere of Schoenberg's _Pierrot Lunaire._
